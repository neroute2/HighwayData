The map disagrees with October 2018 signage in Little Falls.

"River Access" sign in Grand Rapids: https://www.google.com/maps/@47.228908,-93.517599,3a,75y,27.51h,85.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sF0dqk_td5DovCDuNFKe0Gw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656

I'm not sure about the exact location of the north end (it may not be signed past CR117).
