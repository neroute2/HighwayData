The map disagrees with October 2018 signage in Little Falls.

"River Access" sign in Grand Rapids: https://www.google.com/maps/@47.228908,-93.517599,3a,75y,27.51h,85.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sF0dqk_td5DovCDuNFKe0Gw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656

Is this a remnant of a former alignment or an alternate? https://www.google.com/maps/@44.9200244,-93.1096361,3a,17.6y,88.15h,89.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8ejogttR_VBRuJ4nOJGFXA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192 https://www.google.com/maps/@44.9200244,-93.1096361,3a,24.8y,229.35h,89.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8ejogttR_VBRuJ4nOJGFXA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192

I'm not sure about the exact location of the north end (it may not be signed past CR117).
