Lincoln Highway loops: Missouri Valley, west of Logan, east of Logan, south of Woodbine, Glidden-Ralston, State Center-Marshalltown, Le Grand-Montour, west of Tama (don't know which one is the loop), Belle Plaine, Cedar Rapids-Marion-Mount Vernon, Low Moor-Clinton, and northern Clinton.

The area east of Lisbon needs field checking for how it ties into new US 30. Clinton also needs field checking (the signs shown on GSV don't match the source).
