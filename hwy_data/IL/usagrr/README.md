Illinois explicitly signs the national route with special plates.

There are also spurs including:
Grand Tower (loop at GraTowRd and PowPlaRd)
Chester (at IL150_E)
Chester (at IL3_Che)
Fort Kaskaskia (at ShaTr)
Fort de Chartres (at IL155)
Granite City (at I-270(3))
Lewis and Clark State Historic Site (at NewPoagRd)
Kampsville (at IL100_N)
Gladstone Lake

According to http://www.greatriverroad-illinois.org/pdfs/S-N%20Driving%20Directions.pdf it used to go differently between Quincy and Hamilton, which explains inconsistent signage in Hamilton.
