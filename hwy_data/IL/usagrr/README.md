Illinois explicitly signs the national route with special plates.

I don't know why this sign refers to the "eastern branch": https://www.google.com/maps/@41.1873589,-90.9947343,3a,15y,272.07h,86.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sPQPKqlJMS7HE_yGT5Rkdng!2e0!7i13312!8i6656

There are also spurs including:
"info" (at RivDr)
Trail of Tears State Forest (at StaForRd)
Grand Tower (loop at GraTowRd and PowPlaRd)
Chester (at IL150_E)
Chester (at IL3_Che)
Fort Kaskaskia (at ShaTr)
Fort de Chartres (at IL155)
Granite City (at I-270(3))
Lewis and Clark State Historic Site (at NewPoagRd)
Kampsville (at IL100_N)
Gladstone Lake
New Boston (at IL17_W)

According to http://www.greatriverroad-illinois.org/pdfs/S-N%20Driving%20Directions.pdf it used to go differently between Quincy and Hamilton, which explains inconsistent signage in Hamilton.
