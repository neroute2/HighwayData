Signage is generally good.

The route in and on the county roads north of Helena needs field checking, since the signs at Columbia and Perry were changed between 2013: https://www.google.com/maps/@34.529019,-90.5911963,3a,23.2y,10.69h,87.7t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sFU_Q_GtMQs0mnvHEkKPy5Q!2e0!5s20131001T000000!7i13312!8i6656 and 2016: https://www.google.com/maps/@34.5290628,-90.5911934,3a,24.7y,11.32h,84.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssKkhvDegPi14lZIFnR1vNQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 The only source for the route through the forest is https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3791072.pdf

A spur is signed along US 82/278 to Mississippi. A loop is signed along 4 and 1 through Arkansas City, but usually with a simple America's Byway plate and no GRR shield: https://www.google.com/maps/@33.7338321,-91.2898701,3a,35.2y,116.67h,83.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCJjsqlgxVsXrEHQc3aEiEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
