It's not signed with the shields used in other states, but with text under a Scenic Byway logo: https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6604165,-78.7773815,3a,42.3y,157.2h,86.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spqRwzmGPQ5ifqgttH8iWeg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Old alignments are not signed; instead it generally sticks to state highways.
