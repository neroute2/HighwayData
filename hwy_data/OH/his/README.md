I can't find any signs on the old route in South Vienna, despite being in the source. There is at least one in Summerford: https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9337697,-83.491515,3a,15.9y,115.45h,84.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJuNWrTHMwid9o5pB9tMKvw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
Signage in Columbus is not so great, but there's at least one: https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9580206,-82.9795932,3a,23.6y,112.36h,87.9t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOHSl_yaL7Cdxck8z2I8NaA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
I can't find any signs on the old route in Etna, Gratiot, Hopewell, Zanesville, Craig, Hendrysburg, Morristown. I'm not sure how much is signed east of Old Washington. It is signed through Fairview despite being a hanging end: https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0560914,-81.2289656,3a,23.1y,276.75h,86.27t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz_azJEcJvgUeO6euNiLUXQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
