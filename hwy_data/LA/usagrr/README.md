I'm using the latter where they don't match, as that's probably where signs will eventually be posted. Disagreements are: New Roads (former stays on LA 1), Venice (former continues beyond the end of LA 23), New Orleans and south (latter has no eastbank route)

Signs are almost nonexistent.

NEW POINTS: JefAve on 986, StaCapDr on US 61busbat/US 190busbat
